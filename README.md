This is a playground for the [Gittip redesign project](). To play:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/whit537/gittip-redesign-playground.git
$ cd gittip-redesign-playground
$ make run
[...]
```

Then: [http://localhost:9537/](http://localhost:9537/).

You need `python2.7` and `make`, which means you need Xcode.
```

# Play!

 - Markup is in `www/index.spt`
 - Layout is in `scss/playground.css`

Edit and refresh (sorry, no live reload).
